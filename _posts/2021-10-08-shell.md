### About this project

This shell was created as my second programming assignment for my introduction to systems course. It was created within
C++ and supports changing directories, piping, I/O redirection, background processes, and most basic commands. It was made
roughly within the time period of a week and was tested using a virtual machine running an Ubuntu OS.
