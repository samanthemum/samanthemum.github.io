### About this project

Call of Dionysus was my solo development project for the Texas Aggie Game Developers Spring 2022 Game Jam: Descent into Madness. It is a dungeon crawler game with pixel graphics where the player trades sanity to their patron god, Dionysus, in order to receive HP, attack, and speed buffs. It's composed of three levels plus a boss dungeon. It won for Best Programming.
