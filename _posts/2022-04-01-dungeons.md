### About this project

Dungeons and Drinks was created for the 2022 Chillennium competition. I created this with three other amazing game developers in a 48 hour period for the game jam, though it's been updated afterwards to fix bugs and improve features post its submission. At the competition, it won for best visuals. Hopefully, my team and I will continue to implement small updates to this project to make it even better.
