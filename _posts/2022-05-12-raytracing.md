### About this project
This was the final project required from my Computer Graphics course. For this, I created a ray tracer in C++ with some external packages that could render spheres, ellipsoids, planes, and complex objects via OBJ files. In addition to the required aspects of the project, I also created a mixed Blinn-Phong/reflective coloring system and a motion blur effect.
