### About this project

This project was a Java application capable of connecting to an underlying SQL database, Adventureworks, created as my second project
for CSCE 315, my honors programming studio course. It consists of a GUI with two parts: a dashboard that displays interesting employee demographics 
using Xchart and a main interface that allows users to run custom SQL queries as well as some built-in commands. This project was completed over 
the course of approximately a month and a half with two other people.

#### My work

* Created the majority of the backend functionality (ie- using SQL commands to search for columns, calculate statistics, etc.)
* Created the text entry, file saving, and formatting of the main GUI
* Created the pie chart within the Dashboard

#### What I learned

* SQL
* JFrame
* XChat

### Room for improvement
