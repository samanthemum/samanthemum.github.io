### About this project

Desktop Familiar is current a WIP application built using Python inspired by Desktop Goose. The
initial code development process was started by using the guide found here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-desktop-pet-with-python-5b369be18868. Over time, the goal is to familiarize myself with Python's GUI
system and add more and more original features to the program. Planned development is on the GitHub.
