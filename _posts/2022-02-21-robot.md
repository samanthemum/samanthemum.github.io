### About this project
This was the second project required from my Computer Graphics course. The goal of this was to utilize matrix stacks to create hierarchical transformations in an interactive program. The user is allowed to choose any portion of the robot and rotate it, and all body parts lower in the hierarchy will transform with it. This was super fun to work on, and I'm pleased with the end result.
