### About this project

Autunes was created for the Texas Aggie Game Developers Fall 2020 Semester game jam. This was my first trek into solo development, and I learned a lot. I even managed to create a demo level of the game by the first sprint! However, my planning skills waned as I went through the semester, so the final components of the game were rushed- my biggest regret in this project. I plan on coming back and improving aspects that underperformed with knowledge that I've gained from my software engineering internship.

#### My work

* All assets in the game

### What I learned

* Improved knowledge of Unity

#### Room for improvement
