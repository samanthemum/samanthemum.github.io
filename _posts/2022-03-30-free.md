### About this project
This was the fourth project required from my Computer Graphics course. The goal was to take advantage of the view and projection martices to manipulate the camera in such a way that would allow the user to navigate the world using the WASD-keys, mouse, and Z (which is used to zoom in and out). In addition to the main free-look world, I also had to construct an HUD and top-down display that took advantage of using orthographic projection.
