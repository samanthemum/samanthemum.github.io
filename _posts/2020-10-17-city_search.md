### About this project

City Selector was created for the 2020 Datathon. It was created using a Python notebook, Pandas, and Plotly.express. It asked users basic questions about what was important to where they lived, and suggested a city for them based on their responses, as well as a color-coded map of the best places for them to live. It was my first delve into data science computing.

#### My work

* Adjusted the algorithm to get reasonable answers
* Scoured the internet for public, relevant data sets

#### What I learned

* Python libraries (Pandas and Plotly.express)
* How hard it is to find nice, publically available datasets!

#### Room for improvement

* Advancing algorithms used for analysis
