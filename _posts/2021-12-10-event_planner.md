### About this project

This project was my final assignment for my honors programming studio course. It is an event planner add-on for Google Docs, created
with two other people. The add-on allows for a document's creator to select a general location (like Houston, TX) and browse nearby 
restaurants, parks, or event venues. After selecting a place, the creator can generate possible meeting times and a date, fill out 
their own availabiity, and share the document with friends. Visitors on the document can also fill out their availability. The availability 
information is stored in the document as a table.

When all guests finish filling out their availability, the document creator can close the poll. This gives them the opportunity to generate 
a bar chart to help them visualize the availability information to easily find the most open time. After selecting a final time, attendees and 
time information will be added to the document and the owner can create a Google Calendar invite that can automatically be sent to guests.
