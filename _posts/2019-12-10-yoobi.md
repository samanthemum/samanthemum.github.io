### About this project

Yoobi was created for the Texas Aggie Game Developers Fall 2019 Semester game jam. Though I started on this project with 5 others, by the end of the jam, only 3 of us finished the project. This is far from a finished game, but the demo is still available and gives a good idea of where we were going.

#### My work

* Programmed for character movement and teleportation animation
* Created music/sound assets
* Created pause screen and instructions page and the programming controlling them
* Animated and programmed enemies
* Animated teleportation magic and crystals

#### What I learned

* Unity API's
* Krita
* Basic music composition

#### Room for improvement

* Communication skills
* Code organization
* Animation techniques
