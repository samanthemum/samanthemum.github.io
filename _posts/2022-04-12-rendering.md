### About this project
This was the fifth project required from my Computer Graphics course. In this project, we had to implement three features we had never used before: attentuated light, dynamic geometry, and deferred rendering. Through this, I learned a lot about indexed drawings and the concept of doing multiple passes to different frame buffers in order to create a scene, which is also useful for shadow mapping and reflections.
