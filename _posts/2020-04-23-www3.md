### About this project

Waifu War III was created for the Texas Aggie Game Developers Spring 2020 Semester game jam. The team I originally began developing with had to drop the project due to complications caused by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Desipte this, I did continued to work on the project to create a demo for the end of the jam. It was created using to Renpy, an API based in Python for dating simulator games. Though I enjoyed learning it, I would not use this software again for future endeavors.
