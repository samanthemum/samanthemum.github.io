### About this project
This was the third project required from my Computer Graphics course. In this project, I had the opportunity to work with vertex and fragment shaders within OpenGl for the first time. The end result is an interactive program that allows the user to select a material with a unique ambient, diffuse, and specular constant and a shader: normal, Blinn-Phong, silhouette, and cel.
