Hi! My name is Samantha Hallam, and I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I have a heavy interest in game design (which I have a minor in) and computer graphics. I have experience creating games through my own personal projects, but also have professional experience in general software engineering positions through internships. I enjoy learning about new technological developments, whether that's learning how to use a new IDE or a new programming language entirely.
